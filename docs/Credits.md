# **Credits**
This project wouldn’t have been possible without the following key contributors:

- Coffee ☕: For giving my life purpose.
- Bugs 🐛: For constantly reminding us that perfection is overrated.
- Stack Overflow 💻: For answering questions like “Why isn’t my code working?” and “How do I fix my life?"
- The GitHub Dark Theme 🌓: For saving our eyes and sparking joy in our lives.
- The Keyboard ⌨️: For heroically enduring endless typing and the occasional frustrated *pounding* :wink:.
- You 🙌: Yes, you! For taking the time to read this while you should be working on the next *Star Wars*™ reboot or something, idk what the kids are in to these days.

***Real Credits Coming Soon***

Don’t worry, this will be replaced with an actual list of contributors, libraries, and tools when the time comes. In the meantime, feel free to imagine your name here! 

Happy filming! 🎬
