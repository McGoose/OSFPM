# **Glossary**  

Welcome to the Glossary of the ***Open Source Film Production Manager***!  

This is where you will eventually find an exhaustive list of all the fancy film industry terms so you can sound like a pro on set. For now, enjoy these placeholder definitions: 

# **Placeholder Terms**  

**Call Sheet**  
A magical document that tells everyone where to be, when to be there, and what to bring. Ignore it at your peril.  

**Boom Mic**  
A microphone on a big stick. It captures audio and occasionally appears in the corner of your shots for no reason at all.  

**Grip**  
Someone who *grips* things? Probably. (Real definition coming soon, I promise!)  

**Stinger**  
No, itâ€™s not a bee. Itâ€™s actually... uh... okay, I'll look this one up later.  

**Blocking**  
The art of telling actors where to stand without sounding like a bossy GPS.  

**Martini Shot**  
The last shot of the day. Usually followed up by tequilla shots.

**VFX**  
Short for Visual Effects. Used to make explosions, spaceships, or... you know, fix that boom mic from earlier.

I am working on the actual definitions, but until then, feel free to make up your own.

Happy filming! ðŸŽ¬
