# **Architecture**

Welcome to the ***Open Source Film Production Manager Architecture***! Or as I like to call it, *‚ÄúThe Grand Blueprint of Filmmaking Magic.‚Äù* üé¨‚ú®

This document will eventually explain how the application is structured, but for now, here's a placeholder with some very technical terms that sound impressive, but do not mean much (yet).

## **The Basics**

At the core of our system is a combination of various programming languages. You know, what a program needs to work. There is also some (for now non-existent) back-end magic, but I am still figuring out exactly how to make that work.

### Frontend
The frontend is like the director of the app: it‚Äôs in charge of making everything look pretty, functional, and making sure no one gets lost, minus the cocaine, anxiety and self-pitty.

### Backend
Imagine it's like the unsung crew member who makes sure everything works behind the curtain.

### Database
Our data is safely stored somewhere, probably. The plan is to use a relational database, basically a big binder with tabs, where each tab holds a specific piece of information about the film. Nothing has been picked it yet, but relational sounds professional enough, right?

### Data Flow

Right now, data flows only from my brain to my computer. Sometimes it‚Äôs more of a flow and less of a well-thought-out flow. But I am getting there!

## **The Big Picture (Literally)**

Eventually, there will be diagrams here showing how all the pieces fit together. For now, just picture a big movie set with lots of moving parts. (Or a spaghetti junction, depending on your level of optimism).

Stay tuned for a more detailed explanation, once I get the kinks worked out!

Happy filming! üé¨
