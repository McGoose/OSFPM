# **User Guide (Coming Soon)**

Welcome to the ***Open Source Film Production Manager User Guide***!

Well... not exactly the user guide. Yet. You see, "The Goose"â„¢ is hard at work crafting a comprehensive, step-by-step manual to make your filmmaking journey as smooth as a perfectly planned shot.

But for now, hereâ€™s a placeholder guide that probably wonâ€™t help you in any way, except to distract you from actually doing your job:

## **Quick Start Guide (Totally Legitâ„¢):**

- Turn on your computer â€“ If it's already on, youâ€™re way ahead of the game. Nice work!
- Open a browser â€“ Chrome, Firefox, Edge, that one you forgot to uninstall... any will do.
- Navigate to the app (It does not exist yet, but imagine it being beautiful and without bugs)
- Click buttons â€“ All the buttons. Buttons are fun (in your imagination ofc).
- ???
- Profit! Or, at the very least, start making progress on your film (which, of course, this app does not help you do because it does not exist yet).

## **FAQ (Frequently Anticipated Questions)**

```
Q: Why isnâ€™t the guide ready yet?
A: Writing a user guide is like shooting a movie: it takes time, creativity, and a lot of coffee... and I am too lazy to do it.
```
```
Q: Is there a hidden Easter egg in the app?
A: Of course not. (But if you find one, let me know, as it means some work got done that I am unaware of.)
```
```
Q: What if I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m doing?
A: Thatâ€™s the beauty of filmmaking! No one does!
